### Fairness
DICEOS uses a provably fair cryptographic system which means you donâ€™t need to trust us blindly, each roll is cryptographically fair and can be easily verified.


### Randomization
DICEOS uses the snapshot Id of the Mixin Network's transaction to generate bet result.

A snapshot Id is a standard UUID string, which is randomly generated. You can find it by tapping the result text (WIN or LOSE button).

### Verify
The following code example can be used to verify a bet:
```
function verify (msg) {
  let digits = sha512.array(msg)
  let s = sum(digits)
  return s MOD 100 + 1
}
```
