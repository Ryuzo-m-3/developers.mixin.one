### Introduction
Based on the standard REST API, provided by Mixin, it is easy for developers to integrate Mixin's full cryptocurrency wallet and be compatible with each previous version. This demo fully realizes all the functions of a Web version of the full cryptocurrency wallet, the demo: https://wallet.mixcoin.one, source code: https://github.com/over140/mixwallet.

### Create an account
The demo wallet creates a Mixin wallet for each user and sets the initial password according to the user's PIN set.

### List of assets
Configure a custom wallet asset list. All ERC-20 tokens can be deposited to the ETH address. After deposit, the list will be updated, and the new token displayed automatically.

### Deposit and withdraw
You can transfer assets to the demo wallet through Mixin Messenger, which is free and convenient for instant payment and can also support deposit and transfer through other on-chain wallets.

### Keystore
The Keystore exported in this demo meets official standards and can be used in other wallets that support Mixin Keystore.
